# Bluesoft
Hello, I'm Jesus and this is a basic test project for training and example purposes. It is deploying in vercel so you can feel free to go there and test the Application.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.11.

## In local

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code explication:
Well, the project is actually very simple, based on the Bluesoft problem case. 
I used angular with firebase mainly to streamline the development process.

- Reactive libraries like ngrx.
- Use of guards to protect routes.
- Auth by email system stored in the cloud.
- Non-relational database in the cloud as well.
- Pipes, Types, etc.
  
## Features  

- Roles system
- Generate reports by month filter
- Login and register
- Deposit emulator
- Withdrawal emulator
- Transfer to other accounts (still in progress)

You can login with different types of users below I will provide two with different roles.
```
{
  "username": "admin@mail.com",
  "password": "123456",
}
```

```
{
  "username": "user@mail.com",
  "password": "123456",
}
```

With this you can now try the application for yourself.

Greetings and I look forward to your comments and feedback, thank you! :smile:
